autor "Oscar Wilde"
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. 
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect 
to whom beautiful things mean only Beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, 
or badly written. That is all.

afegir text "Where the wild things are"
autor "Oraurice Wendak"
The night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind and another. That very night in his room a forest grew and grew. 
An ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max and he sailed off. When he came to the place where the wild things are they 
roared their terrible roars and rolled their eyes. Max tamed them with the magic trick of staring into their yellow eyes 
without blinking once. They made him king of all wild things.
